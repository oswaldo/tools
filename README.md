Branch expected to contain project assets like images and marp presentations.

For now, presentations should be updated locally with calls like `marp presentations/alpha.md -o presentations/alpha.html`, pushing the resulting HTML.

Then, it can be viewed using htmlpreview like this: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/oswaldo/tools/blob/presentation-alpha/presentations/alpha.html
