  The “oztools” project is a developer's toolkit that
  provides scripts to automate common tasks, aiming to
  enhance effectiveness, simplicity, and convenience. It
  includes scripts for tools like git, aws, brew, curl, and
  more, and allows for easy extensibility to add new tools.
  The project is guided by principles of pragmatism and
  clarity and is currently developed and tested only on
  MacOS with Apple silicon.
